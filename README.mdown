#Crypt
Crypt is a system for centrally storing FilveVault 2 recovery keys. It is made up of a client app, and a Django web app for storing the keys. You will also need to [download and install the webapp](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt-Server).

##Client
The client is written in Pyobjc, and makes use of Google's csfde from Cauliflower Vest to handle the actual encryption on OS X 10.7 and the built in fdesetup on OS X 10.8. An example login hook is provided to see how this could be implemented in your organisation. 

###Features
- If escrow fails for some reason, the recovery key is stored on disk and a Launch Daemon will attempt to escrow the key periodically.
- If the app cannot contact the server, it will quit
